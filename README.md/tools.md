### Tools Needed:
#### p5.js Editor https://p5js.org/:
This is an online editor that allows the coder to create, test, modify their programs. Students will use this in each lesson within the unit. This is an essential tool accomplishing the goal. 

#### p5.js reference/documentation page: 
This webpage is used primarily for teacher use. It allowed the teacher to identify important materials to implement in the lessons.
#### RSB Color Picker: 
This website found in lesson 2 (background), allows students to select and create a variety of colors. Once selected, they will implement it into their program on p5 js editor.
#### Technology in the classroom:
Students will use the computer desktops in the classroom for the entire unit (no homework administered). Teacher will use Smartboard to display lessons and for interactive learning.  
#### Google Slides:
This interactive tool is the main source students will use to access lessons and insert their code. In addition, students will record most of their learning experience on this platform. 
#### Google Docs: 
This interactive tool is a secondary source students will use to record  their learning. This is especially helpful in lesson 2-3.  
#### Online Interactive Games:
Students will use the hyperlinks included, especially in slides 2, 3, 8 and 9 to assist in their learning. They will play games and then use those games to recreate and evaluate. 
Online search engines
Students will use any online search engine such as google.com, and bing.com to search for deeper understanding of/information for their project.
