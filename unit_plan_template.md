# Game Based P5-JS Unit Plan
by Michelle Best and Benson Leung

-----

## General Overview
This will be a project-based unit that will occur right after an introduction to P5-JS.  The students have previously learned how to create print/assignment statements, debugging techniques, expressions, pseudo code, and different variable types.  Throughout this unit, students will learn about if statements, loops, arrays, and lists.  Using this knowledge combined with their previous knowledge, students will be able to create their own games.  The goal of this unit is to create a collection of mini-games inside a bigger game board, similar to Mario Party.  After completion, students will be able to share their projects with their classmates, who will play and provide feedback to improve the game.
Grade level: 6/7

## Motivation for Unit
According to the NYS Computer Science & Digital Fluency Standards for sixth grade, students are required to learn algorithms and programming. While programming can be fun, it can be challenging to understand at times as well. What better way to learn a complex topic than through interactive fun and games. Within this effective game-based learning environment and experimentation, students can actively learn and practice the right way to program using Python.
A Chinese proverb says: "Tell me, and I'll forget. Show me, and I may remember. Involve me, and I'll understand."

## Standards Referenced

Each standard below reflects and supports the summative and formative goals that we have set for the students to accomplish the tasks. Knowing that our lesson plans align with the NY Computer Science Standards, we are confident that students will build in knowledge and understanding throughout this interactive, hands-on unit. 

4-6.CT.4 Decompose a problem into smaller named tasks, some of which can themselves be decomposed into smaller steps.

4-6.CT.5 Identify and name a task within a problem that gets performed multiple times while solving that problem, but with slightly different concrete details each time.

4-6.CT.6 Compare two or more algorithms and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each for a specific task.

4-6.CT.7 Identify pieces of information that might change as a program or process runs.

4-6.CT.8 Develop algorithms or programs that use repetition and conditionals for creative expression or to solve a problem.


7-8.CT.4 Write a program using functions or procedures whose names or other documentation convey their purpose within the larger task.

7-8.CT.5 Identify multiple similar concrete computations in a program, then create a function to generalize over them using parameters to accommodate their differences.

7-8.CT.6 Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.

7-8.CT.8 Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem.
7-8.CT.10 Document the iterative design process of developing a computational artifact that incorporates user feedback and preferences.

## Tools Used


#### p5.js Editor https://p5js.org/:
This is an online editor that allows the coder to create, test, modify their programs. Students will use this in each lesson within the unit. This is an essential tool accomplishing the goal. 

#### p5.js reference/documentation page: 
This webpage is used primarily for teacher use. It allowed the teacher to identify important materials to implement in the lessons.
#### RSB Color Picker: 
This website found in lesson 2 (background), allows students to select and create a variety of colors. Once selected, they will implement it into their program on p5 js editor.
#### Technology in the classroom:
Students will use the computer desktops in the classroom for the entire unit (no homework administered). Teacher will use Smartboard to display lessons and for interactive learning.  
#### Google Slides:
This interactive tool is the main source students will use to access lessons and insert their code. In addition, students will record most of their learning experience on this platform. 
#### Google Docs: 
This interactive tool is a secondary source students will use to record  their learning. This is especially helpful in lesson 2-3.  
#### Online Interactive Games:
Students will use the hyperlinks included, especially in slides 2, 3, 8 and 9 to assist in their learning. They will play games and then use those games to recreate and evaluate. 
Online search engines
Students will use any online search engine such as google.com, and bing.com to search for deeper understanding of/information for their project.

## Assessments
The final project is the summative assessment.

Formative assessments is daily teacher observation are the compiled code at the end of each lesson.
